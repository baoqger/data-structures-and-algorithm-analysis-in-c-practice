This directory exists for legacy:

The implementation for "void infixTopostfix(char*);"
is same as that in "postfix-c" directory. The only difference
is that, the version in this directory has "ET" as:

  typedef char ET;

However, inside "postfix-c" directory, "ET" is defined as:

  typedef char* ET;

The version in this directory is simpler than the version in "postfix-c".
I implement "postfix-c" version is for engineering purpose: put both
"void infixTopostfix(char*);" and "void postfixToinfix(char* filename);"
under the same data structure framework to make the overall repo structure
not very chaotic.
